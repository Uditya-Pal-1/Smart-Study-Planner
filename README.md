ðŸš€ Personal Smart Study Planner
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Your New Study Companion!
Ever feel like your to-do list is a tangled mess of subjects, deadlines, and forgotten notes? I built this Smart Study Planner to fix that. It's a clean, simple, and powerful web app designed to help you get organized without the extra clutter. Think of it as your digital study sidekick, here to help you conquer your goals one task at a time.

âœ¨ What's Inside?
Create Your Subjects: Easily add all your classes or topics and give each one a custom color.

Add Any Task: Whether it's a big project or a small chore, you can add all the detailsâ€”title, due date, priority, and notesâ€”to keep everything in one place.

See Your Progress: The handy progress bar shows you exactly how much you've accomplished. It's super satisfying to watch it grow!

Visualize Your Week: The dynamic timeline gives you a beautiful, chronological overview of your tasks. Just scroll to see what's coming up next!

Drag & Drop Magic: Need to shuffle your schedule? Simply drag and drop tasks on the timeline to reorder them instantly.

Your Data is Safe: Everything you add is saved right in your browser. No accounts, no sign-ins, just your data, ready for you whenever you return.

Get Reminded: Set an alarm to pop up when a task is due. No more excuses for missing a deadline!

Switch to Dark Mode: Give your eyes a break with a single click.

ðŸ¤“ A Peek Under the Hood
This project was built with simplicity in mind, using the essentials:

HTML: The skeleton of the app, giving structure to all the sections.

CSS: The magic behind the look and feel! It uses modern design with variables to make the UI pop and includes a slick dark mode.

JavaScript: The brain of the operation. It handles all the fun stuff, like saving your data to your browser, making the progress bar work, and enabling the drag-and-drop feature.

I built this to be a helpful tool, but I know it can be even better! If you have any suggestions, spot a bug, or just want to chat about the project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'd love to hear from you!
